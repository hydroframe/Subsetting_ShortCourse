# Subsetting_ShortCourse
Materials for the Short Course: Subsetting Using HydroFrame and HydroData

## Getting Started
To get started:
  - [Sign up](https://hydrogen.princeton.edu/signup) for a HydroFrame account
  - [Register a PIN](https://hydrogen.princeton.edu/pin) for API access

## Running Exercises
There are two options we recommend for running the example notebook activities:
  - Run in a Binder session by clicking the ![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg) logo at the top of each notebook.
  - Follow the [Docker instructions](https://github.com/hydroframe/Subsetting_ShortCourse/blob/main/Docker_instructions.md) for setting up and running in our Docker container.

If you would like to use these tools in your own virtual environment, you may or may not need a valid ParFlow installation available. The `subsettools` package requires a ParFlow installation while the `hf_hydrodata` package does not. Both `subsettools` and `hf_hydrodata` are Python packages and can be installed with `pip install subsettools` and `pip install hf-hydrodata`. Please see the [ParFlow Installation Guides](https://github.com/parflow/parflow/wiki/ParFlow-Installation-Guides) for how to install ParFlow on your system.

## Additional Information
This course is meant to be an introduction to using `subsettools` and `hf_hydrodata`. Please see our online documentation for [subsettools](https://hydroframesubsettools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [hf_hydrodata](https://hf-hydrodata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for additional example workflows and full API documentation.
